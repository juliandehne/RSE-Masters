## Statistical Data Analysis

This module focuses on the statistical study and quantitative analysis of the dependence between observed random variables (e.g., yield/production settings; lifespan/treatment type and injury type).
Essential foundations for the statistical treatment of such relationships are provided by the linear regression model, which is studied in detail in the first part of the lecture.
Within this framework, topics such as estimation, testing, and uncertainty quantification (analysis of variance) are addressed.
In the second part, an introduction to advanced methods and approaches for examining relationships is offered, including nonlinear and nonparametric regression models.
Additionally, questions of classification and dimensionality reduction are covered.
