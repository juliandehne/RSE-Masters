## Wildcard Science Module

This module offers RSE students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of a scientific discipline outside of their home domain. Students choose a science module — such as physics, chemistry, biology, or earth sciences — and engage with its research practices, core questions, and data/software challenges.

The goal is to help students become better collaborators by gaining first-hand exposure to the terminology, logic, and needs of another scientific domain. This broadens the student’s ability to apply RSE skills in interdisciplinary teams and unfamiliar environments.

The module may consist of lectures, lab sessions, and domain-specific mini-projects. RSEs are encouraged to reflect on how software engineering, data handling, reproducibility, and tooling intersect with the chosen discipline.

This module is deliberately flexible to accommodate institutional offerings and student interests as well as providing the option to stay attached to the identity of the chosen discipline.
